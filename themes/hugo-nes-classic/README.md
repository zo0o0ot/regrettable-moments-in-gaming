# hugo-nes-classic

A minimalistic Hugo theme using the NES.css framework (https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/). This is my first theme. PRs for improvents are welcome! :)

Since I neither want to include some build steps nor want to depend on external hosting for the CSS files I included a copy of the NES.css sourcecode. Kudos to B.C.Rikko <https://github.com/BcRikko>

The theme is as simple as it can get. The homepage lists all pages and blog posts and the menu items can be configured in the config.toml descriptor.

The exapmle site can be found in a dedicated repo: https://github.com/rjayasinghe/hugo-nes-classic-example
